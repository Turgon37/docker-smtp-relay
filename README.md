This image contains an instance of Postfix SMTP server configured as a SMTP relay.
This relay is restricted to only one domain name. so it means that only mail that come from RELAY_MYDOMAIN will be relayed to the relayhost.

:warning: Take care of the [changelogs](CHANGELOG.md) because some breaking changes may happend between versions.

## Supported tags, image variants and respective Dockerfile links

* main image with postfix [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Turgon37/docker-smtp-relay/blob/master/Dockerfile)

    * `latest`


## Example of usage

This relay can take place into a information system if you want to give access to some web or other applications a way to send notification by mail.

The advantage of this configuration is that only the host in theses case are allowed to send emails through this relay :

* The host IP's address is in the range of RELAY_MYNETWORKS
* The host is authenticated with a valid SASL login/password

## Docker Informations

* This port is available on this image

| Port | Usage                        |
| ---- | ---------------------------- |
| 25   | SMTP for incoming relay user |

* This volume is bind on this image

| Volume             | Usage                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| /data              | Contains the flat database that contains all SASL user                                       |
| /var/spool/postfix | Where postfix store mail queue (to persist not yet delivered mails across container restart) |

* This image takes theses environnements variables as parameters

## Todo

* Improve smtp healthcheck
* Add prometheus exporters (https://github.com/engage-ehs/rsyslog_exporter https://github.com/kumina/postfix_exporter)


## Installation

* Manual

```bash
git clone
./build.sh
```

* or Automatic

```bash
docker pull turgon37/smtp-relay
```

## Usage

```bash
docker run --name smtp-relay -p 25:25 -e "RELAY_MYDOMAIN=domain.com" -e "RELAY_HOST=relay:25" turgon37/smtp-relay
```

### Docker-compose Specific configuration examples

* unauthenticated smtp relay filtered by subnet and domain name

```yaml
services:
  smtp-relay:
    image: turgon37/smtp-relay:latest
    environment:
      RELAY_POSTMASTER: 'postmaster@example.net'
      RELAY_MYHOSTNAME: 'smtp-relay.example.net'
      RELAY_MYDOMAIN: 'example.net'
      RELAY_MYNETWORKS: '127.0.0.0/8 10.0.0.0/24'
      RELAY_HOST: '[10.1.0.1]:25'
    ports:
      - "10.0.0.1:3000:25"
```

* authenticated smtp proxy

```yaml
services:
  smtp-relay-auth:
    image: turgon37/smtp-relay:latest
    environment:
      RELAY_POSTMASTER: 'postmaster@example.net'
      RELAY_MYHOSTNAME: 'smtp-relay.example.net'
      RELAY_MYDOMAIN: 'example.net'
      RELAY_MYNETWORKS: '127.0.0.0/8 10.0.0.0/24'
      RELAY_HOST: '[10.1.0.1]:25'
      RELAY_MODE: 'ALLOW_SASLAUTH_NODOMAIN'
      RELAY_LOGIN: 'sasl-user-login'
      RELAY_PASSWORD: 'xxxxxxxxxxxx'
      RELAY_USE_TLS: 'no'
      POSTCONF_compatibility_level: '2'
    ports:
      - "10.0.0.1:3000:25"
    volumes:
      - data-smtp-relay-auth:/data
      - data-smtp-relay-queue:/var/spool/postfix
volumes:
  data-smtp-relay-auth:
  data-smtp-relay-queue:
```

### Using external relay credentials

If you want to prevent having your relay credentials in your docker-compose file, you can mount them (instead of setting
`RELAY_LOGIN`and `RELAY_PASSWORD` variables) into `/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd`

Taking again our `authenticated smtp proxy` example above, we would now have:

```yaml
services:
  smtp-relay-auth:
    image: turgon37/smtp-relay:latest
    environment:
      RELAY_POSTMASTER: 'postmaster@example.net'
      RELAY_MYHOSTNAME: 'smtp-relay.example.net'
      RELAY_MYDOMAIN: 'example.net'
      RELAY_MYNETWORKS: '127.0.0.0/8 10.0.0.0/24'
      RELAY_HOST: '[10.1.0.1]:25'
      RELAY_MODE: ALLOW_SASLAUTH_NODOMAIN
      RELAY_USE_TLS: 'no'
      POSTCONF_compatibility_level: '2'
    ports:
      - "10.0.0.1:3000:25"
    volumes:
      - data-smtp-relay-auth:/data
      - "/my/local/path/sasl_passwd:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd"
volumes:
  data-smtp-relay-auth:
```

And our local `sasl_passwd` file would have as contents:

```bash
user@host:~$cat /my/local/path/sasl_passwd
[10.1.0.1]:25 sasl-user-login:xxxxxxxxxxxx  
```

### Configuration during runtime

* List all SASL users :

```bash
docker exec smtp-relay /opt/listpasswd.sh
```

* Add a SASL user :

If you have a host which is not in the range of addresses specified in 'mynetworks' of postfix, this host have to be sasl authenticated when it connects to the smtp relay.

To create a generic account for this host you have to run this command into the container

```bash
docker exec -it smtp-relay /opt/saslpasswd.sh -u domain.com -c username
```

You have to replace domain.com with your relay domain and you will be prompt for password two times. Then you will be prompted for password two times

* Add multiple SASL users :

If you want to add multiple sasl users at the same time you can mount (-v) your credentials list to /etc/postfix/client_sasl_passwd
This list must contains one credential per line and for each line use the syntax  'USERNAME PASSWORD'  (the username and the password are separated with a blank space)

You can check with docker logs if all of your line has been correctly parsed


### Troubleshooting

An simple SMTP client is embedded with this image. You can use it to test your settings

```
docker exec -it smtp-relay /opt/smtp_client.py -s test -f noreply@domain.com --user user1:password1 admin@domain.com
```
